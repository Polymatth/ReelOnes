- **Scope of Changes:** Keep the scope of your pull request focused. If your change addresses multiple issues, consider splitting them into separate pull requests.
  
- **Link to Issues:** If your changes fix a bug or implement a feature requested in an issue, reference that issue in the PR description (e.g., "Fixes #123").
  
- **Code Style:** Ensure your code follows the project's coding style and formatting conventions. If the project uses linters or formatters, run them before submitting your PR.

**Protocols for Reviewing Contributions and Merging**

- **Initial Review:** A project maintainer will review the pull request, ensuring it adheres to the project's guidelines and doesn't introduce issues.

- **Code Quality Check:** We will verify that your changes align with our code quality standards (e.g., clean code, appropriate comments, no duplicate code).
  
- **Testing:** Before merging, we will test the changes to ensure they work as expected and do not break existing functionality.
  
- **Approval:** If everything is in order, the pull request will be approved and merged into the main branch. If changes are needed, feedback will be provided, and the contributor will be asked to make the necessary adjustments.
  
- **Squash and Merge:** We prefer to squash commits into a single commit before merging to keep the commit history clean. This will be done automatically when the PR is merged.
Communication: Please be responsive to feedback and updates to ensure a smooth review process. If any conflicts arise, contributors may be asked to resolve them before the PR can be merged.
