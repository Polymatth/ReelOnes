Universal Design Principles:

1) Equitable Use

-Design is visually appealing and legible

-Users are not separated based on any criteria

-All users have the capacity to use all features

-Unfortunately, visually impaired users will face challenges using the software.

2) Flexibility in Use

-Program places no demands on user speed or dexterity

-There are numerous ways to search a movie

-Lists are multipurpose tools that are not imposed on users

-As of now, it is assumed that the user has seen at least one movie and has a favourite film and director, and is capable of spelling both of those correctly

3) Simple and Intuitive Use

-The use of textual labels on our buttons allows users of differing experience/knowledge of computers to use our program without relying on culturally significant symbols such as plus signs. This does, however, currently have the drawback of requiring the user to be literate in English, restricting who can use the application

4) Perceptible Information

-Colours were chosen to maintain high contrast between, buttons, text, and static elements such as the background.

-Font size is legible from a standard viewing distance.

-Pictures as well as text is used to depict films in the search query

-Unfortunately, there is no auditory component to our project as of now

5) Tolerance for Error

-As of now, there is unfortunately a low tolerance for error in regard to completing search queries. Incorrect spelling may result in no search results with very little feedback to the user or attempts to search for similar phrases.

-User may incorrectly spell favourite movie or director resulting in affected recommendations

6) Low Physical Effort

-Program requires standard use of a mouse and keyboard

-Some improvements could be made such as the ability to navigate with solely the keyboard (e.g. pressing enter to 
trigger the search query)

7) Size and Space for Approach and Use

-Buttons such as film search results are large and granted space from each other to ensure ease of use


Our program can be marketed to cinephiles, those who consider themselves highly engaged film viewers that have a 
propensity to catalog the films they have seen or intend to watch. Audiences of this variety may struggle to find 
recommendations or independently discover films that cater to their increasingly niche taste. ReelOnes encourages users 
to manually aggregate the films most significant to them and then leverages this information to provide new recommendations 
that the user may not be aware of. This program would be less appealing to audiences that would consider this cataloging 
process fatiguing or audiences that have not seen many films and are thus more satisfied by popular recommendations.

Due to accessibility concerns such as the required use of a keyboard and mouse, lack of auditory feedback, and a 
preference for English literacy our program is less likely to  be used by users that fall outside of those demographics. 
In the future, steps should be taken to make the program more universal, be it device availability, hardware interface, 
simplification of the user interface. Unfortunately, resource limitations prevent us from utilizing approaches such as 
language localization/translation to make the program accessible to more users.
